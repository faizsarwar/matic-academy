But even in our experiences as two very different people, we both remember the same three core things that kept us going: <b> caring mentors, strong support from friends, and understanding teachers </b> that saw us as unique individuals.</p>\n                <br>\n                <p>Juni works because it’s modeled after those three key pillars. <b> Juni Instructors </b> are that mentor—the role model that guides, but also the friend and teammate that cheers you on through your challenges. <b> The Juni Community </b> is that tight-knit group of friends and like-minded peers for inspiration and collaboration. And our <b> dynamic platform and curriculum </b> are shaped after those teachers that empowered us to stay curious, be creative, and drive our own lessons.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"col p-3\">\n                <p>Our own experiences, as well as the inspiring stories from countless Juni students give us confidence in Juni’s approach. Today, we’re both ex-Google employees, and founders of our own Silicon Valley tech company—these were our dreams, but they don’t have to be yours. <b> We believe that joyful learning will empower kids everywhere to discover, and then achieve whatever future they can dream of. </b></p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </section>\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n<section class=\"pt-5 pb-5\" style=\"background-color:#5a3cf0\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-4\">\n           <img src=\"../assets/img/professional.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"ml-5 mr-3 mt-5  \" style=\"background-size:contain; width:390px;height:370px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-align: center;border-radius:50%\">\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-8\" style=\"text-align: center;\" >\n        <div class=\"row\">\n          <div class=\"ml-5 mr-4 mb-0\">\n            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"96\" height=\"96\" fill=\"#a195de\" class=\"bi bi-quote\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\">\n              <path d=\"M12 12a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V8.558a1 1 0 0 0-1-1h-1.388c0-.351.021-.703.062-1.054.062-.372.166-.703.31-.992.145-.29.331-.517.559-.683.227-.186.516-.279.868-.279V3c-.579 0-1.085.124-1.52.372a3.322 3.322 0 0 0-1.085.992 4.92 4.92 0 0 0-.62 1.458A7.712 7.712 0 0 0 9 7.558V11a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h2Zm-6 0a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V8.558a1 1 0 0 0-1-1H4.612c0-.351.021-.703.062-1.054.062-.372.166-.703.31-.992.145-.29.331-.517.559-.683.227-.186.516-.279.868-.279V3c-.579 0-1.085.124-1.52.372a3.322 3.322 0 0 0-1.085.992 4.92 4.92 0 0 0-.62 1.458A7.712 7.712 0 0 0 3 7.558V11a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h2Z\"/>\n            </svg>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"row text-left\">\n          <h1 class=\"p-5 mb-3 ml-2 mr-5 mt-0\"><b style=\"color:white !important\">I love working with students and watching them grow!</b> </h1>\n          <h5 class=\"pl-5  pr-5 mb-3 ml-2 mr-5 mt-0\" style=\"color:white !important\">I’ve been teaching one of my students twice a week for over a year and a half - we’ve had over 123 sessions together.
